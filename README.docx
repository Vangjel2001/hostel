Software Engineering Project Description

Worked By: Vangjel Dhima, BINF 3 B
Project Topic: Engineering a Student Hostel Management System Application
Team Leader: Vangjel Dhima
Team Members: Vangjel Dhima

Problem Statement:
Student hostels are types of residences that provide tenants with common spaces to meet up. Thus, the students can live in a single or shared room and can be able to take advantage of these common spaces to meet other students and carry out their daily activities.
 	Without a software that acts as a management system, student hostels are typically run manually. There is a lot of pressure on the person in charge of the hostel. Information regarding students, rooms etc. is not easily accessible. It is not easy to immediately find vacant rooms for new customers for example.
	Therefore, an application could really help to manage student hostels more effectively and efficiently.

Project aim:
To engineer a student hostel management web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

Application Functionalities /Project Objectives:
•	Keep track of student information
•	Keep track of student guardian information (a person like the student’s father or older brother)
•	Keep track of room booking/reservation information
•	Keep track of room information
•	Make it possible for a new customer to sign up
•	Make it possible for existing customers and the administrator to log in and change passwords
•	Make it possible for students to manage their room/rooms (view rooms and reservation details, make another reservation, cancel reservations and edit them)
•	Make it possible for students to manage their profiles (view and edit them)
•	Make it possible for the hostel administrator to manage students (view, add, edit, remove students)
•	Make it possible for the hostel administrator to manage student guardians (view, add, edit, remove student guardians)
•	Make it possible for the hostel administrator to manage rooms (view, add, edit, remove hostel rooms)
•	Make it possible for the hostel administrator to manage booking information (view, add, edit, remove hostel room reservations)
•	Make it possible for the administrator to view and change his/her username and password
•	Make the application user-friendly
•	Make the application secure, especially from HTML and SQL injections
•	Protect passwords provided by the application users
•	Fulfill all the application requirements and specifications
•	Test the application continuously
•	Evolve the application to meet possible new requirements
•	Document the whole software engineering process
